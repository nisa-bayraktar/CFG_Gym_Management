# CFG Gym Management
Code First Girls Databases &amp; SQL Project

# About the Project 
CFG Gym Management is a group project that was made to complete Code First Girls Introduction to Databases & SQL Certifiate Programme. The project aims to create a new gym membership database to impelement basic and advanced SQL queries and features that are the project requirements below:

- Create relational  DB of your choice with minimum 5 
tables
- Set  Primary  and  Foreign  Key  constraints  to  create 
relations between the tables
- Using  any  type  of  the  joins  create  a  view  that 
combines multiple tables in a logical way
- In your database, create a stored function that can be 
applied to a query in your DB
- Prepare  an  example  query  with  a  subquery  to 
demonstrate  how  to  extract  data  from  your  DB  for 
analysis 

- In  your  database,  create  a  stored  procedure 
and demonstrate how it runs
- In  your  database,  create  a  trigger  and 
demonstrate how it runs
- In  your  database,  create  an  event  and 
demonstrate how it runs
- Create  a  view  that  uses  at  least  3-4  base 
tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that 
uses the view to produce a logically arranged 
result set for analysis.
- Prepare an  example  query  with  group  by and 
having  to  demonstrate  how  to  extract  data 
from your DB for analysis

# Deployment
You can open the CFG_GYM_Membership_Mangement.sql file on the SQL Workbench and run the whole script. The code is commented according to the requirement bullet points above to make it more clear. ER_CFG_GYM_Membership_Management.mwb file is the ER Diagram of the database, you can see the table contents and their relations by opening this file on the SQL Workbench.
